NPM has many React data visualization packages available. Most of them are built by utilizing some JavaScript data visualization library,
such as _chart.js_, _d3.js_, etc. `react-time-series-chart` is based on [LightningChart JS](https://lightningchart.com/js-charts/), the
**most powerful charting solution in the world**. This gives it several incredible advantages compared to other options:

1. **Incredible loading speed and data capacity**

`react-time-series-chart` can display a data set with _10 million data points in 0.1 seconds_.

2. **Built-in Time Series support**

No more hacks with tick placement and label formatting. Input data directly from a database with UTC timestamps and enjoy built-in Time
Series support.

3. **Out of the box analysis tools and user interactions**

No extra work needed for data cursors, panning, zooming, etc.

4. **Lightning-fast rendering speed**

All operations, interactions, updates etc. are refreshed with 60 FPS - always. No more laggy user experiences.

5. **Modern graphics, visual look, animated quality of life experience**
